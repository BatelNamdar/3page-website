        <h3>Welcome to the Department of Neuroscience!</h3>
        <p>The Department of Neuroscience values all diversity. We may not always get it right but we care and we will continue to show-up with the intention of valuing each individual.  We stand opposed to systemic racism and to biases in all dimensions of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socio-economic background, politics, and health status.  In particular at this moment in time, we stand in solidarity with our Black students and colleagues. To the Black community and to all people of color we see you, we hear you, we value you, and we stand with you to bear witness.

            Kathy Maguire-Zeiss, PhD, Chair & Professor, Department of Neuroscience</p>
